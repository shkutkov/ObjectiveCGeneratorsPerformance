## Overview

The goal of this project is to measure performance of different generators implementation in Objective-C.

Currenly we are testing:

* Asynchronious and Synchronious versions of [SMGenerator](https://github.com/shkutkov/SMGenerator)
* [MAGenerator](https://github.com/mikeash/MAGenerator)
* [EXTCoroutine](https://github.com/jspahrsummers/libextobjc/blob/master/extobjc/EXTCoroutine.h)

The project already has 3 tests:
* Generating numbers from 1 to 100000
* Printing numbers from 1 to 1000 to the console
* Generating first 1000 prime numbers that are bigger than 100000 and printing them to the console

It's possible easily create new tests.
All tests can be started on iOS and OSX.
